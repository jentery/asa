# Notes toward Speculative Computer Vision 

Computer vision is generally associated with the programmatic description and reconstruction of the physical world in digital form (Szeliski 2010: 3-10). It helps people construct and express visual patterns in data, such as patterns in image, video, and text repositories. The processes involved in this recognition are incredibly tedious, hence tendencies to automate them with algorithms. Such processes are also increasingly common in everyday life, expanding the role of algorithms in the reproduction of culture. From the perspective of economic sociology, A. Aneesh links such expansion to "a new kind of power" and governance, which he refers to as "*algocracy*—rule of the algorithm, or rule of the code" (Aneesh 2006: 5). Here, the programmatic treatment of the physical world in digital form is so significantly embedded in infrastructures that algorithms tacitly shape behaviors and prosaically assert authority through bureaucracy. Routine decisions are delegated (knowingly or not) to computational procedures that, echoing the work of Alexander Galloway (2001) and Wendy Chun (2011), run in the background as protocols or default settings.

As an example, consider the banal and now ubiquitous integration of CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) into online submission forms. By prompting you to type obscure letters into a box, CAPTCHAs ask, "Are you human?" In so doing, they regulate information flow and implicitly assume quite a bit about people (e.g., that "humans" are not blind, do not have low vision, or do not have dyslexia). In many cases, such as Google’s reCAPTCHA initiative, CAPTCHAs also assist computing projects in their digitization, annotation, and machine-learning efforts. When computer vision cannot identify a visual pattern, CAPTCHAs forward the pattern to people for manual remediation into distinct alphanumeric characters. This data is then integrated back into collections of electronic texts or used to train algorithms to interpret more content. Understood this way, a person's response to "are you human?" is also a gesture that helps the machine. In economic terms, these quotidian exchanges are mutually beneficial, or at least efficient: CAPTCHA algorithms protect websites from malicious bots and optical character recognition (OCR) attacks, while people provide desired information and verification without consuming much of their own time and effort. Once naturalized online, such algocratic tasks become inconsequential in the instance yet extremely meaningful, and strikingly productive of value, in the aggregate.

But my argument today does not focus on algocracy or even CAPTCHAs, even if it is deeply informed by them both. In short, it is about *the need for computer vision techniques that privilege speculation over confirmation*. It is not invested in delegating authority to algorithms; it is also not about mobilizing that vision toward efficiency, or even about foregrounding patterns in repositories, either. It does not, for intance, encourage the algorithmic discovery of historical causes that, until now, have rested ghost-like beyond the threshold of our perception. Instead, my argument is that *speculative approaches to computer vision may resist dichotomizing media and mediation, digital and analog materials, automated and manual labor, and human and machine phenomenologies*. Rather than capturing or re-presenting the world, speculative computer vision may help people develop a "critical technical practice" (Agre 1997: 155) advocated by scholars such as Tara McPherson (2012) and Alan Liu (2012). For example, it may begin by relinquishing any assumptions that computer vision can be fully understood as, or simply reduced to, "source code." Computer vision necessarily involves lived experience and embodied politics, even if both are frequently dismissed in the name of speedy processing and immediacy. In fact, a brief history of computer vision across the disciplines demonstrates how important experience and embodiment are to this processing.
